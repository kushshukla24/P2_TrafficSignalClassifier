**Traffic Sign Recognition System**
Traffic signals are way of imposing rules to ensure safe and smooth transportation system in a country. So, its imperative for a  Self-Driving Car to abide by rules by understanding/detecting and acting according to the dynamic traffic signals while the car is on the road.

List of files in Repository:
1. Traffic_Sign_Classifier.pynb is the python notebook containing the code for this project
2. report.html is the html of the notebook, for viewing of the results
3. report.md conatins the detailed writeup for the project.
4. Other Folders and files contains input/images/dataset/intermediaries while model generation and resources for the writeup.
