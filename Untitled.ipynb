    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing**: A two level preprocessing is done for all images:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Converting images to gray scale. This changes input 3 channels images to 1 channel gray scale image. On the task of classifyingthe traffic siginals, the goal is to interpret the shape in the image and map ping it to some siginal class. Colors here will not add value and reducing the channels will reduce data hence faster computation.\n",
    "    So the equals weightage is given to each channel to convert the image from 3 to 1 channel gray scale.\n",
    "2. To make optimizer job easy and for numerical stability reasons, all images are normalized with simple\n",

    "I decided to generate additional data because few traffic siginals have very less training images. Also augmenting the training dataset will images in diffrent orientation, lightenings will help models to grow more robust.\n",

Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* What were some problems with the initial architecture?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  With the first architecture the model is posing the problem of overfitting on the training data set.\n",
    "  As I was able to achieve, 98% accuracy on the training while the validation accuracy is stuck at 78-79%.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  As the training and validation accuracy was diverging, it was clear that model suffers from overfitting on training set. So, to introduce regaularization I introdeced couple of dropout layers between the fully connected layers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  I tunned the hyperparameters in a guided manner to achieve better results from the model. \n",
    "  Methodology: Keeping all other parameters same, increasing the parameter in incremental manner to see the improvement in the accuracy.\n",
    "  Applying the above methodology individually for learning rate, epochs and batch size for the model, parameters are finalized for the model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Dropout layer between the fully connected layers will work well because randomly selecting the link between the fully connected layers will make the model robust as it will not de dependent on particular nodes of the fully connected layer. and this will result in more robust and better fitted model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* What architecture was chosen?\n",
    "\n",
    "  LeNet-5 architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?\n",
    "\n",
    "  LeNet-5 model performed well when trained on MNIST dataset where the goal is to classify hand-written digits images to digital digits(0-9). similarly, our goal is classify the traffic images to one of (0-42) traffic siginal category. so, almost similar problem. This instigated to apply LeNet for traffic siginal\n",

    "  \n",
    "* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?\n",
