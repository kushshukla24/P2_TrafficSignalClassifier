    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing**: A two level preprocessing is done for all images:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Converting images to gray scale. This changes input 3 channels images to 1 channel gray scale image. On the task of classifying the traffic siginals, the goal is to interpret the content of the image and map it to some traffic siginal class. Colors here will not add value as I am trying to learn the traffic siginals through learning shapes in images thus converting to single channel. Morevover, reducing the channels will reduce data hence faster computation.\n",
    "    So the equals weightage is given to each channel to convert the image from 3 to 1 channel gray scale.\n",
    "2. To make optimizer job easy and for numerical stability reasons, all images are normalized with simple\n",
    "  (pixel_value - 128)/128\n",
    "  rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a traffic sign image stepwise preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image6]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Through data exploration activity, it is clear that the training data contains less number of images for few traffic signs. \n",
    "So, I decided to augment the training data by generating new images for less frequent traffic signs. Also augmenting the training dataset will help models to grow more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology Used**: I picked the traffic signs having less than 1000 images for them, and then generated multiple copies of the existing images with randomly perturbing following characterstics till the number of images for each traffic sign reaches above 1000 images:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scaling about X,Y axis in range (0.9,.1)\n",
    "2. Translation about X,Y in range (-7,7)% ~ (-2,2)px\n",

Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",

    "* validation set accuracy of **96.2%**\n",
    "* test set accuracy of **94.4%**\n",
    "\n",
    "* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The first architecture was Lenet5 (shown in the table above as Other Architecture) but without the dropout layers between the fully connected layers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* What were some problems with the initial architecture?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  With the first architecture the model is posing the problem of overfitting on the training data set.\n",
    "  As I was able to achieve, 98% accuracy on the training while the validation accuracy is stuck at 78-79%.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  As the training and validation accuracy was diverging, it was clear that model suffers from overfitting on training set. So, to introduce regaularization I introduced couple of dropout layers between the fully connected layers. This gives bumped my validation accuracy to ~96%.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The final architecture I tried from the article \"Traffic Sign Recognition with Multi-Scale Convolutional Networks\"- Pierre Sermanel and Yann LeCunn. With this architecture, my training accuracy went to 100%, however not much improvements were detected for validation and test set.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  I tunned the hyperparameters in a guided manner to achieve better results from the model. \n",
    "  Methodology: Keeping all other parameters same, increasing the parameter in incremental manner to see the improvement in the accuracy.\n",
    "  Applying the above methodology individually for learning rate, epochs and batch size for the model, parameters are finalized for the model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Dropout layer between the fully connected layers will work well because randomly selecting the link between the fully connected layers will make the model robust as it will not de dependent on particular nodes of the fully connected layer. and this will result in more robust and better fitted model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* What architecture was chosen?\n",
    "\n",
    "  LeNet Convolutional Neural Network architecture was finally choosen with few modifications as described in article \"Traffic Sign Recognition with Multi-Scale Convolutional Networks\"- Pierre Sermanel and Yann LeCunn were incorporated.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?\n",
    "\n",
    "  LeNet model performed well when trained on MNIST dataset where the goal is to classify hand-written digits images to digital digits(0-9). similarly, our goal is classify the traffic images to one of (0-42) traffic siginal category. so, almost similar problem. This instigated to apply LeNet for traffic siginal problem.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?\n",
    "\n",
    "  With the introduction of Dropout layers between the fully connected layers and architecture described in reference article, the problem of overfitting on training data set solved as validation accuracy bumped from 78 to 96%, which is much close to training 100% as compared to before. \n",
